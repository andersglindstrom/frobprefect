Set Up
------------------

Prefect depends on Docker. Make sure you have it installed on your machine.

Next, create and activate virtual environment and install dependencies:

```
$ virtualenv -p38 venv/frobprefect
$ source venv/frobprefect/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Do the examples in the following order. Each one has its own `readme.md`

* `local_1`
* `docker_1`
* `docker_2`
